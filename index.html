    <h2>How to make these delicious, hot tasty burgers? <br>
    Here it is!</h2>

    <p>
        Beans of your choice, canned, or cooked from dry. If you use canned put the water in too.  About 2 cups of Brown rice, a cup of oats, any kind will do. 2 medium to large potatoes, a can of tomatoes and peppers, put in the water from the can, a half cup chia seeds, chili powder, and not nesissary (I can't spell it) a half cup protein powder, a cup of tvp for texture if you have it, chopped onion and garlic to your taste. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You add all that to a slow cooker and cover it with water. Cook it to as much of a mush as you can, I usually just put it on ten hours and watch it. When it's all cooked I use a potato masher to get it kind of creamy but I use it to keep bean chunks in it because I like that.

        Then I shape it into a burger form on a pan that fits in my air fryer,  I add a few squirts if oil to the pan so it doesn't stick and a few squirts of it on top so it doesn't dry out. I fry it for 20 minutes on one side and 375, let it cool a bit because the underside us still mushy at this point.  I flip it and give it about 10 minutes more in the air fryer. Let cool a bit for firmness and so I don't burn my mouth. Eat, enjoy.
You can half cook them and freeze them so you can have quick meals!

    <H2>Enjoy!</H2>
